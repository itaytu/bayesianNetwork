# bayesianNetwork
<p>In This project, I've implemented a simple program to simulate a Bayesian Network - with the ability to use the Bayes-ball algorithm and variable elimination on the BN.</p>
<p>The program receives an input file with the wanted configurations and runs the queries to calculate the solution. See this <a href="input.txt">example</a> to understand the configurations.</p>
